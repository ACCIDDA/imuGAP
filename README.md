# imuGAP

`{imuGAP}` provides a fitting and imputation / prediction tool for a particular process model of vaccination uptake. The tool provides flexible trends and relationships for the elements of the process.

Briefly, the process model consists of two parts: a lifetime tendency towards vaccination and a time varying force of vaccination. Those effects occur in a nested setting - a largest enclosing population, with mutually exclusive internal populations down to a lowest resolution level.
